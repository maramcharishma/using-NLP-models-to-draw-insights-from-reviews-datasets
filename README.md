# Using NLP models to draw insights from reviews datasets
This project aims to extract meaningful insights from large collections of reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The specific objective is to cluster reviews based on their sentiment (positive or negative) and summarize each cluster into a few key insights.

### Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You also need to install the following libraries:

Scikit-learn (for clustering and text preprocessing)
Transformers (for summarization using T5 transformer model)
You can install these libraries using the following command:

Copy code
pip install scikit-learn transformers
### Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:
