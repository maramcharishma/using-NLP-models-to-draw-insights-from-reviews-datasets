The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.   This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.   Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.   Yes, it's that bad.   I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.   & That movie was bad.   The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.   The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.   I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.   I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.   I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.   Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.   Everything about it is just bad.   The script is bad, very bad ¬ñ it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.   Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.   This may be the only bad film he ever made.   So bad...well...it's just bad.   This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.   I thought it was bad.   Let's start with all the problems¬óthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.   Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!   It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.   Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.   It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.   But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.   I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.   The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.   Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.   Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.   Exceptionally bad!  \n",

      "summarize: The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.   I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.   Even worse than Ticker!   But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.   The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.   The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.   Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.   Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  \n",

There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.   Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.   The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.   He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.   If you want a real scare rent this one!   It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.   I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.   I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.

      "summarize: There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.   These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.   It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.   The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.   I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.   This film has no redeeming features.   In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.   But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.   Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.   About half way through this film I started to dislike it.   By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.   putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.   This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.   I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.   Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.   Regardless, the film fails on most levels.   Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.   Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.   The film gives meaning to the phrase, \"Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.   ) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.   It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.   One of the worst shows of all time.   Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.   That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.   The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.   Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.   Definitely worth seeing¬Ö it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.   If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.   Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  \n",

      "summarize: Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.   Wasted two hours.   The problem was the script.   It was horrendous.   The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.   I don't think you will be disappointed.   Very disappointing.   The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.   ), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.   My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.   I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.   Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.   You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.   It was so BORING!   Horrible!   Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!   I hate movies like that.   It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.   I mean this in a terrible way.   Everything is appalling.   Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.   Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.   It's just lame.   It is shameful.   If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.   Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.   Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!   Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.   Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.   It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.   1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.   Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.   Not even good for camp value!   The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.   Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.   About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.   Of course, the acting is blah.   I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.   It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.   This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.   I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.   His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.   there are so many problems i dont know where to start.   first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.   The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.   The script is a big flawed mess.   One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.   Not recommended.   He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.   I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.   The budget was evidently very limited.   However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.   Not recommended.   Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.   There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.   It's just painful!   The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.   Avoid at all costs.   Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10   Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.   Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.   If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.   It is not good.   Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.   There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.   It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.   The results, well, are a shame.   The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.   The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.   So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.   Avoid, avoid, avoid!   It will drive you barking mad!   And it was boring.   I am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.   I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.   How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.   In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.   Avoid at ALL costs!   Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.   The worst one of the series.   You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.   Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.   It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella \"The Dead.   Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.   Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.   End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.   This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.   Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.   This one just fails to create any real suspense.   As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.   Hated it.   I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.   Not easy to watch.   It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.   It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the \"gadget\".   This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.   Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.   It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).   I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!   In a word, it is embarrassing.   All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  \n",

      "summarize: A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.   The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.   I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.   The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!   Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.   This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.   I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.   This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.   The story is beyond stupid.   If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.   This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.   Everything about this movie is stupid.   This movie has a cutting edge to it.   I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.   All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.   This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere.   I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.   You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.   This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.   This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.   A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.   20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.   (very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.   but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.   the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.   Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie \"Grim\", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.   The movie is terribly boring in places.   To sum the film up, \"Breeders\" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.   I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.   What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?   I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.   Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.   It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.   But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.   This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.    With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  \t1\n",

And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.   No plot whatsoever!   Again, no plot at all.   THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!   The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.   There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.   But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.   The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.   The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.   Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.   there is no real plot.   There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.   Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.   The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  \n",

      "summarize: Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.   I'll even say it again ¬ñ this is torture.   This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!   Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!   The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.   I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  \n",
